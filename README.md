# PDF Interpreter ‚Äî RAG AI Assistant

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload PDF files, index their contents, and query them using a large language model. It combines FastAPI for the backend, Streamlit for the user interface, Qdrant as a vector database for storing embeddings, and Groq/OpenAI models for generating responses. The application processes PDFs into text chunks, embeds them, stores the vectors, and retrieves the most relevant content to provide accurate, context-based answers.
