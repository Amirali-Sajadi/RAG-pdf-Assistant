# PDF Interpreter ‚Äî RAG AI Assistant

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload PDF files, index their contents, and query them using a large language model. It combines FastAPI for the backend, Streamlit for the user interface, Qdrant as a vector database for storing embeddings, Groq models for generating responses, and Inngest for orchestrating ingestion and query workflows. The application processes PDFs into text chunks, embeds them, stores the vectors, and retrieves the most relevant content to provide accurate, context-based answers.
